# pager-chat
Chat application with some validations

steps to reproduce:

1. Clone the project into any directory you previously create.
2. Yarn install
3. Yarn start.
4. Go to localhost:3000.

TO-DO list.

There are some features I would implement but I couldnt because I focused on the functioning, escalability and deliver;
 * Centralize more features on Redux.
 * Liter and prettefier.
 * Maybe some code splitting for future
 * For sure testing.
